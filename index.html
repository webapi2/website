  <h1>Dear Trishna&#9829;
    ,</h1>
  <p id="par"> 
    I don't really know how I can express my feelings to you, because I wasn't myself the first time I set eyes on you.
    My world is spinning and I can't sleep. My throat closes whenever you speak. My heart bursts just being around you. 
    How can I get closer to you?You have a place in my mind. I don't know many things about you. But I feel your absence. 
    I feel so much happy and tension free when you are with me. I want you as my life partner. 
    I want to spend my whole life with you.
    I don't know how to impress you or your parents but I will try my best to do so.
    
    I believe you will understand me. I want to keep you as a flower I'm charged with looking after. Being with you is like being in paradise.
    I will take this responsibility seriously, if you are mine and mine alone. I respect you. 
     Your secret love.
